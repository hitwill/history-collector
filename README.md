# History Collector

Scan the history archives of the kin blockchain, and create a database that contains payment and account creations.

## How does it work?
The python script constantly downloads files from the blockchain's s3 archive, parses them using [xdrparser](https://github.com/kinecosystem/xdrparser), filters payments and account creations and store these operations in a [postgres SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

## Notes
* Only payment and creation operations are saved to database.
* Operation indexes start counting from 0
* Saved attributes are: source, destination, memo **text**, tx hash, fee, fee_charged, tx_status, operation_status, and timestamp
* For payments, amount is also saved
* For creation, starting balance is also saved
* The source account will be the source of the operation, if it exists.
* The service stores the last file scanned in the database, so you can restart the service without starting all over again
